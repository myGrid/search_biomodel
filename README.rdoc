= search_biomodel

search biomodel is a small gem ready to be used for running queries through the biomodel web service API. 

There are (currently) 3 methods to communicate with the biomodels website (found at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/). 

These methods are "search_by_chebiid", "search_by_name" and "get_all_models". The former two return an array and the latter a hash map of :key and :value

== Installation 

  gem install seach_biomodel

== Usage
example:
  
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'seach_biomodel'

  include SysMODB::SearchBiomodel


  puts "\n\n ------------------ List All -----------------------------\n\n"

  all_models = get_all_models
  all_models.each { |item| puts "ID = #{item[:key]}    |    NAME = #{item[:value]}\n" }


  puts "\n\n ------------------ By Chebiid --------------------------\n\n"  i=0

  models_by_chebiid = search_by_ChEBIID("CHEBI:15422")
  models_by_chebiid.each { |item| puts "#{i+=1} #{item.to_s}\n"}


  puts "\n\n ------------------ By Name -----------------------------\n\n"  i=0

  models_by_name = search_by_name("Kolomeisky2003")
  models_by_name.each { |item| puts "#{i+=1} #{item.to_s}\n"}


  puts "\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"
